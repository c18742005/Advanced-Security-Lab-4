# Advanced Security 1 - Lab 4

## Lab Instructions
- Part A - Using any tool create your private and public key. Make sure that you keep your private key secure.
- Part B - In this part you have to send an encrypted email or attachment to xxxxxxxxxxxxx@gmail.com. You will have to create your private and public key pair, send your public key to xxxxxxxxxxxx@gmail.com. Remember that I must have your public key, otherwise, I will not be able to decrypt your email or attachment.
- Part C - There are several cryptographic uses for a clock. Key management functions are often linked to deadlines. The current time can provide both a unique value and a complete ordering of events. Install either network time protocol (NTP) or precision time protocol (PTP) in your computer and check if it is working.
List and give examples of attacks that can be mounted against a system with a clock.
- Part D - You must write a program to implement RSA encryption and decryption. Small numbers can be used.

## Submission Guidelines
1. Presentation
    - Create 5 to 8 PowerPoint slides (1 or 2 slides for each part)
    - Create a video screen recording verballing describing your presentation slides and content of your assignment.
    - The video should be 5 minutes max.
2. Report 
    - It will contain Part C and Part D only in word or PDF format

## How to run the RSA Encryption and Decryption App
- Navigate to the scripts/ directory
- Execute compile.sh to compile the program
- Execute execute.sh to start the GUI
- Enter the message you want to encrypt
- Click "Submit" to encrypt and subsequently decrypt the message
